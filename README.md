# Engineering Problem Solver

This is a simple web application designed to solve engineering problems. 

**Currently, it is a work in progress and does not have any actual problem-solving capabilities.**

## How it Works

1. **Input:** The user enters their engineering problem into the text area.
2. **Solve:** The user clicks the "Solve Problem" button.
3. **Solution:** The application will (eventually) process the input and display a solution.

## Future Development

The main goal is to implement the logic to solve various engineering problems based on user input. This will likely involve:

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** To understand the problem description.
* **Engineering Knowledge Base:** A database of engineering principles and formulas.
* **Problem-Solving Algorithms:** To apply the knowledge to the specific problem.
